# RowingAnalysis
**Rowing Data Analysis Project**

**Overview**
Welcome to my Rowing Data Analysis Project. This repository is dedicated to analyzing data collected from my rowing sessions on an RP3 rowing ergometer. The primary goal is to gain insights into various aspects of my rowing performance, including stroke efficiency, power output, endurance, and pacing strategies.
I will be recording a range of rowing workouts (following the workout plan at my boat club) including UT2, UT1 amd 

**Current Status**
ðŸš§ [In Progress] - I am currently in the process of collecting and compiling data from my rowing sessions.

**Data Collection**
Data is being collected for each rowing session, including the following metrics:

Stroke Number
Power
Average Power
Stroke Rate
Time
Stroke Length
Distance
Distance per Stroke
Estimated 500m Time
Energy per Stroke
Total Energy Expenditure
Pulse
Work per Pulse
Peak Force
Peak Force Position
Relative Peak Force Position
Drive Time
Recovery Time
Drag Factor (k)
Force Curve Data
Stroke Number in Interval
Average Calculated Power

**Goals of the Project**
Analyzing Performance Trends: To observe and understand trends in performance across different metrics over time.
Optimizing Rowing Technique: To identify the most efficient stroke rate, stroke length, and power output.
Understanding Cardiovascular Response: To explore the relationship between physical exertion and heart rate during different rowing sessions.

**Hypotheses**
Several hypotheses will be tested through this analysis, including but not limited to:
1) There is an optimal stroke rate and power output for maximum efficiency.
2) Consistent stroke rate and power output lead to better endurance and overall performance.
3) There is a significant correlation between stroke rate, power output, and heart rate.

**Tools and Technologies**
Data Collection: RP3 Rowing Ergometer, Garmin HRM-Dual
Data Processing: MATLAB for advanced data analysis and visualization.
Machine Learning: Potential future use of PyTorch for predictive modeling and deeper data analysis.
Repository Management: GitHub

**Future Directions**
Machine Learning Exploration: Plan to leverage PyTorch to apply machine learning techniques to the data, potentially developing predictive models for performance optimization.
